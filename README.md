# Hubersity

**Hubersity** is a web-based platform designed to make student life simpler, clearer, and more connected across universities. It provides a centralized space where students can find essential academic information, ask questions, and engage in meaningful discussions with peers from their own and other institutions.

## Purpose

Many students face confusion and repetitive issues due to scattered resources, lack of peer support, and inconsistent communication channels. Hubersity aims to solve this by creating a centralized and intuitive study forum that brings together:

- Shared academic resources
- Course-related Q&A
- Student experiences
- Cross-university collaboration

## Key Features

- University-specific forums and discussion areas
- nteractive discussion boards with searchable posts , users can choose to view content from followed users only or from the entire university community.
- Study timer feature that tracks learning progress and updates visual states dynamically based on study duration.
- Private chat system allowing direct messages between users.
- Supports image, video, and file attachments within both posts and chat messages.
- University-based feed filtering and selection system with a clean, modern, and responsive UI design.
